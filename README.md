> A blockchain crowdfund platform for women upliftment

Women in our society have been heavily downplayed and dealt a bad hand by no fault of their own for a very long time and since the advent of the 21st century this prevalant notion has been challenged again and again to the point where it is being kicked into a thing of the past. Our aim was to contribute what we could to accelerate that movement. The governments of the states have been busy cooking up initiatives for women upliftment and poverty eradication with movements like "Kudumbashree" by The Kerala Govenrnment. Our platform enables such women and motivates the unmotivated to start programs and ventures on their own or as a group by becoming an exclusive one of a kind, first in the world crowd funding platform powered by the latest and greatest Blockchain technology for the women of the world. 

This repository contains:

1. The pre-alpha version of the user interface for the platform
2. Code for the blockchain which handles all the transactions
